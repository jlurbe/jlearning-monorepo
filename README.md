<a alt="Nx logo" href="https://nx.dev" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nrwl/nx/master/images/nx-logo.png" width="45"></a>

This workspace is a monorepo managed by [Nx](https://nx.dev) for the JLearning project, a Japanese language learning application.

## ‚ú® Tech Stack

- **Monorepo:** Nx
- **Backend:** NestJS, TypeORM, SQLite
- **Frontend:** React, Vite, TypeScript, React Router

## üì¶ Projects in this Workspace

This monorepo contains the following main applications:

- `jlearning-api`: The backend REST API built with NestJS. It handles business logic and database interactions.
- `jlearning-front`: The frontend application built with React and Vite.
- `jlearning-front-e2e`: End-to-end tests for the frontend application.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS version recommended)
- `npm`, `yarn`, or `pnpm`

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Install the dependencies from the root of the monorepo:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

## üíª Development

To run the applications in development mode, you can run the backend and frontend servers concurrently in separate terminals, or use Nx to run both at once:

### Run Backend and Frontend Together

```sh
nx run-many -t serve -p jlearning-api jlearning-front
```

Or, run each individually:

#### Running the Backend API

```sh
nx serve jlearning-api
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

#### Running the Frontend

```sh
nx serve jlearning-front
```

The frontend application will be available at `http://localhost:4200`.

## üÜï New Features

- **AI-powered Vocabulary Extraction:** Paste or type Japanese text and let the app automatically extract and analyze vocabulary using Google Gemini (Gemini API key required for backend).
- **Batch Add Words:** Add multiple words at once, with duplicate handling and efficient bulk insert.
- **Editable Vocabulary Table:** Edit, filter, search, and sort your vocabulary. Supports inline editing, column visibility, and multi-column paste.
- **Stats Dashboard:** Visualize your progress with stats for total, mastered, learning, and reviewing words.
- **Modern UI:** Responsive, accessible, and themeable interface using Tailwind CSS and Radix UI components.
- **End-to-End Testing:** Playwright-based E2E tests for frontend reliability.

## üõ†Ô∏è Building for Production

To create production-ready bundles for the applications:

- **Backend:** `nx build jlearning-api`
- **Frontend:** `nx build jlearning-front`

The output will be placed in the `dist/` directory.

## ‚úÖ Running Tests

To execute the unit tests for a specific project:

- **Backend:** `nx test jlearning-api`
- **Frontend:** `nx test jlearning-front`

## üí° Useful Nx Commands

- **Visualize the Project Graph:**
  ```sh
  nx graph
  ```
- **See Project Capabilities:**
  ```sh
  nx show project <project-name>
  ```
