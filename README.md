## ‚ú® Tech Stack

-   **Monorepo:** Nx
-   **Backend:** NestJS, TypeORM, SQLite
-   **Frontend:** React, Vite, TypeScript, React Router

## üì¶ Projects in this Workspace

This monorepo contains the following main applications:

-   `jlearning-api`: The backend REST API built with NestJS. It handles business logic and database interactions.
-   `jlearning-front`: The frontend application built with React and Vite.
-   `jlearning-front-e2e`: End-to-end tests for the frontend application.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (LTS version recommended)
-   `npm`, `yarn`, or `pnpm`

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Install the dependencies from the root of the monorepo:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

## üíª Development

To run the applications in development mode, you can run the backend and frontend servers concurrently in separate terminals.

### Running the Backend API

```sh
nx serve jlearning-api
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Running the Frontend

```sh
nx serve jlearning-front
```

The frontend application will be available at `http://localhost:4200`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Building for Production

To create production-ready bundles for the applications:

-   **Frontend:** `nx build jlearning-front`

The output will be placed in the `dist/` directory.

## ‚úÖ Running Tests

To execute the unit tests for a specific project:

-   **Backend:** `nx test jlearning-api`
-   **Frontend:** `nx test jlearning-front`

## üí° Useful Nx Commands
